# LOG FACILITY
# The syslog facility that should be used for logging purposes.

log_facility={{ nsca_config_log_facility }}

# Check Result directory.  If passed, skip command pipe and submit
# directly into the checkresult directory.  Requires Nagios 3+
# For best results, mount dir on ramdisk.

{% if nsca_config_check_result_path %}
check_result_path={{ nsca_config_check_result_path }}
{% else %}
#check_result_path=/usr/local/nagios/var/checkresults
{% endif %}


# PID FILE
# The name of the file in which the NSCA daemon should write it's process ID
# number.  The file is only written if the NSCA daemon is started by the root
# user as a single- or multi-process daemon.

pid_file={{ nsca_config_pid_file }}



# PORT NUMBER
# Port number we should wait for connections on.
# This must be a non-priveledged port (i.e. > 1024).

server_port={{ nsca_config_server_port }}



# SERVER ADDRESS
# Address that NSCA has to bind to in case there are
# more as one interface and we do not want NSCA to bind
# (thus listen) on all interfaces.

{% if nsca_config_server_address %}
server_address={{ nsca_config_server_address }}
{% else %}
#server_address=192.168.1.1
{% endif %}



# NSCA USER
# This determines the effective user that the NSCA daemon should run as.  
# You can either supply a username or a UID.
# 
# NOTE: This option is ignored if NSCA is running under either inetd or xinetd

nsca_user={{ nsca_config_nsca_user }}



# NSCA GROUP
# This determines the effective group that the NSCA daemon should run as.  
# You can either supply a group name or a GID.
# 
# NOTE: This option is ignored if NSCA is running under either inetd or xinetd

nsca_group={{ nsca_config_nsca_group }}



# NSCA CHROOT
# If specified, determines a directory into which the nsca daemon
# will perform a chroot(2) operation before dropping its privileges.
# for the security conscious this can add a layer of protection in
# the event that the nagios daemon is compromised.  
# 
# NOTE: if you specify this option, the command file will be opened
#       relative to this directory.

{% if nsca_config_nsca_chroot %}
nsca_chroot={{ nsca_config_nsca_chroot }}
{% else %}
#nsca_chroot=/var/run/nagios/rw
{% endif %}



# DEBUGGING OPTION
# This option determines whether or not debugging
# messages are logged to the syslog facility. 
# Values: 0 = debugging off, 1 = debugging on

debug={{ nsca_config_debug }}



# COMMAND FILE
# This is the location of the Nagios command file that the daemon
# should write all service check results that it receives.
# Note to debian users: icinga and nagios3 have
# different default locations for this file.  this is the
# default location for icinga
# command_file=/var/lib/icinga/rw/icinga.cmd
# and this is the default location for nagios3:
command_file={{ nsca_config_command_file }}

# ALTERNATE DUMP FILE
# This is used to specify an alternate file the daemon should
# write service check results to in the event the command file
# does not exist.  It is important to note that the command file
# is implemented as a named pipe and only exists when Nagios is
# running.  You may want to modify the startup script for Nagios
# to dump the contents of this file into the command file after
# it starts Nagios.  Or you may simply choose to ignore any
# check results received while Nagios was not running...

alternate_dump_file={{ nsca_config_alternate_dump_file }}


# AGGREGATED WRITES OPTION
# This option determines whether or not the nsca daemon will
# aggregate writes to the external command file for client
# connections that contain multiple check results.  If you
# are queueing service check results on remote hosts and
# sending them to the nsca daemon in bulk, you will probably
# want to enable bulk writes, as this will be a bit more
# efficient.
# Values: 0 = do not aggregate writes, 1 = aggregate writes

aggregate_writes={{ nsca_config_aggregate_writes }}



# APPEND TO FILE OPTION
# This option determines whether or not the nsca daemon will
# will open the external command file for writing or appending.
# This option should almost *always* be set to 0!
# Values: 0 = open file for writing, 1 = open file for appending

append_to_file={{ nsca_config_append_to_file }}



# MAX PACKET AGE OPTION
# This option is used by the nsca daemon to determine when client
# data is too old to be valid.  Keeping this value as small as
# possible is recommended, as it helps prevent the possibility of
# "replay" attacks.  This value needs to be at least as long as
# the time it takes your clients to send their data to the server.
# Values are in seconds.  The max packet age cannot exceed 15
# minutes (900 seconds).  If this variable is set to zero (0), no
# packets will be rejected based on their age.

max_packet_age={{ nsca_config_max_packet_age }}



# DECRYPTION PASSWORD
# This is the password/passphrase that should be used to descrypt the
# incoming packets.  Note that all clients must encrypt the packets
# they send using the same password!
# IMPORTANT: You don't want all the users on this system to be able
# to read the password you specify here, so make sure to set
# restrictive permissions on this config file!

{% if nsca_config_password %}
password={{ nsca_config_password }}
{% else %}
#password=
{% endif %}



# DECRYPTION METHOD
# This option determines the method by which the nsca daemon will
# decrypt the packets it receives from the clients.  The decryption
# method you choose will be a balance between security and performance,
# as strong encryption methods consume more processor resources.
# You should evaluate your security needs when choosing a decryption
# method.
#
# Note: The decryption method you specify here must match the
#       encryption method the nsca clients use (as specified in
#       the send_nsca.cfg file)!!
# Values:
#
# 	0 = None	(Do NOT use this option)
#       1 = Simple XOR  (No security, just obfuscation, but very fast)
#
#       2 = DES
#       3 = 3DES (Triple DES)
#	4 = CAST-128
#	5 = CAST-256
#	6 = xTEA
#	7 = 3WAY
#	8 = BLOWFISH
#	9 = TWOFISH
#	10 = LOKI97
#	11 = RC2
#	12 = ARCFOUR
#
#	14 = RIJNDAEL-128
#	15 = RIJNDAEL-192
#	16 = RIJNDAEL-256
#
#	19 = WAKE
#	20 = SERPENT
#
#	22 = ENIGMA (Unix crypt)
#	23 = GOST
#	24 = SAFER64
#	25 = SAFER128
#	26 = SAFER+
